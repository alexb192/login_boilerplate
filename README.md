# login_boilerplate

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the exact same boilerplate I used in my react project, Biscord.
I made this previously as I was trying to understand how to make a working login page in react while trying to make it as secure as possible.
It's not exactly a plug in boilerplate since there's a lot of stuff to edit, as this is hooked up to a phpmyadmin database on my linux machine.
However, this is probably really handy if you want to understand how to get something like this to work, and I intend on using it as my own boilerplate.
